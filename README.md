# SpringBootQuiz
The Quiz is about simple sales system, the system should include products management, client’s management and sales operationsmanagement.


***********************************************************************

This work requires more improvements that I did not do because I do not know how to deal with spring boot and I do not have time to learn more about it,
especially the issue of multiple relationships between classes.

So I tried to get rid of relationships so that I could achieve the quiz
